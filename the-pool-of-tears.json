These apples were always counted, and about the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one of them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. \n\nThe gardener set his eldest son to watch; but about twelve oâ€™clock he fell asleep, and in the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself under the tree to watch.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"series/the-pool-of-tears.md","sha":"cb9b6a0f78c4e38761ba16b83fcc2d8092e91131"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-08-02T12:41:21.000Z"}
