  A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree which
  bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about the time when
  they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one of them was gone.
  The king became very angry at this, and ordered the gardener to keep watch all
  night under the tree.
